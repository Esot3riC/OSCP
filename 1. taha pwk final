mkdir -p test/{recon,exploit,report}

Finding Files in Kali Linux-----find, locate, which
which--> The which command 39 searches through the directories that are defined in the $PATH environment variable for a given file name. ($ which sbd)
locate---> locate searches a built-in database named locate.db rather than the entire hard disk itself. To manually update the locate.db database, you can use the
           updatedb command. ($ sudo updatedb----- $ locate sbd.exe)
find--> ($ sudo find / -name sbd*) perform a recursive search starting from the root file system directory and look for any file that starts with the letters “sbd”
        find . -type f -readable ! -executable -size 1033c
        find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null

Question solve--> Use find to identify any file (not directory) modified in the last day, NOT owned by the root user
Answer--> find /home/maddy/Desktop/ -mtime -1 -type f -user maddy (https://www.baeldung.com/linux/recently-changed-files)

SSH service-->(port 22) commonly used to remotely access a computer, using a secure, encrypted protocol. The SSH service is TCP-based ($ sudo systemctl start ssh)
              using the ss command and piping the output into grep to search the output for “sshd” ($ sudo ss -antlp | grep sshd)
              SSH service start automatically at boot time ($ sudo systemctl enable ssh) 
        To see a table of all available services, run systemctl with the list-unit-files option ($ systemctl list-unit-files)
          $ ssh bandit14@localhost -i sshkey.private -p 2220

apt-cache search and apt show--> apt-cache search command displays much of the information stored in the internal cached package database.
                               For example, let’s say we would like to install the pure-ftpd application via APT. The first thing we have to do is to 
                               find out whether or not the application is present in the Kali Linux repositories.
                               ($ apt-cache search pure-ftpd)
                      apt-show--> There are also a few authentication extensions for the pure-ftpd application that may be installed if needed. the detsilds are 
                              availaible in system or not we can confirm through it ($ apt show resource-agents)

apt remove -–purge--> command completely removes packages from Kali. It is important to note that removing a package with apt remove removes all package data
                      but leaves usually small (modified) user configuration files behind, in case the removal was accidental. Adding the --purge
                      option removes all the leftovers.(sudo apt remove --purge pure-ftpd)

dpkg-----------> dpkg is the core tool used to install a package it does not require an Internet connection. Note that dpkg will not install any dependencies 
                that the package might require To install a package with dpkg , provide the -i or --install option and the path to the 
                .deb package file. This assumes that the .deb file of the package to install has been previously downloaded or obtained in some other way.
                ($ sudo dpkg -i man-db_2.7.0.2-5_amd64.deb)

History command tricks-->> !156 run commad from history in link number 156
                           !! run previous command.

Strings Command--> we can read some content of non-redable file using this command


----------------------------------------------------------------CHAPTER-3-------------------------------------------

PATH environment variable:---- https://geek-university.com/linux/path-environment-variable/

history command---> Rather than re-typing a long command from our history, we can make use of the history expansion facility
                    !34   run the command which is currently on line 34
                    !!    run previous(last) commnad
                    HISTSIZE controls the number of commands stored in memory for the current session and HISTFILESIZE configures how many commands 
                    are kept in the history file

nano command line editor----> touch comma^o to write changes to the file, ^k to cut the current line, ^u to un-cut a line and paste it at the cursor location,
                  ^w to search, and ^x to exit.

vi/vim command line editor---> I to insert the data, use dd to delete the current line, yy to copy the current line, p to paste the clipboard contents,
                                 x to delete the current character, :w to write the current file to disk and stay in vi,
                                :q! to quit without writing the file to disk, and finally :wq to save and quit.

COMM file compair command---> 60 comm file1 file 2
DIFF file compair command---> 61 context format ( -c ) and the unified format ( -u ) diff -c scan-a.txt scan-b.txt



monitor files and commands in real-time--------------- commands tail and watch
     tail:--> monitor the Apache logs in real time ($ sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log ~-f= contineu update the output file~) 
                                                   (-nX switch-->which outputs the last “X” number of lines~ $ sudo tail -n3 /var/log/apache2/access.log)
     watch:--> used to run a designated command at regular intervals. we can specify a different interval by using the -n X option to have it run
                every “X” number of seconds. bydefault it is 2 second
               $ watch -n 5 w (w command for check logged in users)

Alias Command:--> give a name to command that use frequently ($ alias lsa='ls -la') now we can execute ls -la using lsa command. 
                 list of defined aliases by running alias without arguments and unalias to remove command.



----------------------------------------------------------------CHAPTER-4- Tools Used------------------------------------------ 

NETCAT command-------------------->
    1. nc -nv 10.11.0.22 110 (connect to a port)
    2. nc -nlvp 4444 (steup server / listning port)
    3. nc -nlvp 4444 > incoming.exe (transfer file usning port number 4444)

   Page- 78
   The netcat-traditional version of Netcat (compiled with the “-DGAPING_SECURITY_HOLE” flag) enables the -e
   option, which executes a program after making or receiving a successful connection. When enabled, this option can redirect the input, output, 
   and error messages of an executable to a TCP/UDP port rather than the default console.

BIND SHELL---Bind shells have the listener running on the target and the attacker connect to the listener in order to gain a remote shell.
REVERSE SHELL--- Reverse shells have the listener running on the attacker and the target connects to the attacker with a shell.

Socat (PAGE-84) is a command-line utility that establishes two bidirectional byte streams and transfers data between them.---->
POWERSHELL
POWERCAT:- generate STANDALONE psyloads and encrypt them.

TCPDUMP:----Tcpdump can both capture traffic from the network and read existing capture files. Let’s look atwhat happened in the password_cracking_filtered.
             pcap file, 107 which was captured on a firewall. ($ sudo tcpdump -r password_cracking_filtered.pcap)
To dump the captured traffic, we will use the -X option to print the packet data in both HEX and ASCII 108 format:
$ sudo tcpdump -nX -r password_cracking_filtered.pcap


----------------------------------------------------------------CHAPTER-5- Bash Scripting(105)------------------------------------------ 
Bash scripts have an optional extension of .sh (for ease of identification), begin with #!/bin/bash. #! is commonly known as the shebang,
chmod command, along with the +x option is used to make the script executable.

Variables:---> Variables are named places to temporarily store data. We can set (or “declare”) a variable,we precede the variable with
the “$” character.
read command:---> capture interactive user input, use read to capture user input and assign it to a variable
SearchSploit:----> is a command line search tool for Exploit-DB that allows us to take an offline copy of the Exploit Database with us wherever we go
$ searchsploit afd windows -w -t
grep:--> again with -v , which is a “reverse-grep” $grep -v "Nmap" | awk '{print$2}'
cutycapt:-->  133 which is a Qt WebKit web page rendering capture utility.
Netcraft:--> Netcraft 148 is an Internet services company based in England offering a free web portal that performs various information gathering functions.
Recon-ng:--> recon-ng 149 is a module-based framework for web-based information gathering
